I will print out both this document and the gantt chart tomorrow. Any changes should be posted in this text file and made to the progress report before then.

[Dan W] - Removed the issues & concerns.  Randy would like us to only use this section for serious issues outside of progress, such as fighting within the the group; things that we would need instructor involvement to solve.
[Dan W] - Expanded title (few words saying what the system is, so we have more than just its name).
[Dan W] - Added section mentioning gantt chart.
[Dan W] - Changed "widget" terminology to "pages".  I think we sort of stopped following the planned widget system a long time ago heh.
[Dan W] - Added percentage values to some lines that were missing it.  Still need some in the "individual progress planned" section, but I'm not sure what percentages to enter there.
